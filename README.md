## About Me

My name is **Naim Shaqqou.** I am a *Junior* stuyding Computer Science at the *University of Central Florida.*
I recently switched majors from a medical background since I discovered that I have a passion for Computer Science and Mathematics. I love the idea of creating projects that will have a real impact on the world. My whole life I have been surrounded and fascinated by technology, and since I have been exposed to the conceptual part behind the technologies we all know, I have fallen in love. 

My **hobbies** include:
<ul>
  <li>Weightlifting</li>
  <li>Modifying Cars</li>
  <li>Gaming</li>
  <li>Travelling (I would love to set time aside to do that soon)</li>
</ul>

## What I am Up To

I am currently searching for an **internship** in **Software Engineering** since I feel ready for the next chapter in my career that will allow me to follow my passions.  
I have learned a great number of algorithms and problem solving techniques in class, and I have been researching independently to expand my knowledge.

I am using this GitHub page to showcase my personal and class **projects.**
